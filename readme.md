# Sylvan Benchmarks

This repository contains benchmarks for my collection of [Sylvan](https://github.com/MarkPflug/Sylvan) .NET libraries, 
comparing them with other libraries in the .NET ecosystem.
The benchmarks are written using [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet).
The various libraries provide different APIs, so the while each benchmark has slightly 
different construction, I believe they provide a fair comparison.  
If any of the benchmarks are found to be incorrectly setup, 
I'd happily welcome a pull request with a fix.

Many of the benchmarks in this collection use sample "Sales Record" data files from
[excelbianalytics.com](https://excelbianalytics.com/wp/downloads-18-sample-csv-files-data-sets-for-testing-sales/).
This files contains 14 columns of multiple data types including string, integer, date, and decimal.

## Running benchmarks

`benchmark.cmd`

This will compile and run the benchmark project, which will then present 
a selection for which benchmark set to run.

## Benchmark Environment

Benchmark results were updated with latest package versions as of Nov 14, 2023, as well as updating to .NET 8.0.
